# Hangman Game

## The Game
The computer randomly chooses a word from a given set of words (here a set of mathematics related words) and displays each letter as a blank to the user. The user has to guess each letter of the word. The maximum admissible number of incorrect guesses is 6, after which the user will be given a final chance to guess the word as a whole.

*Note.* The user won't be penalised for wrongly guessing a letter more than once, instead will be shown a message regarding the same.
